# Basic Switch Network Lab

## Objective
Connect two PCs via a Cisco switch to establish a simple LAN and verify connectivity.

## Devices Used
- 2 PCs (PC0, PC1)
- 1 Cisco 2960 Switch

## IP Configuration
- PC0: IP: 192.168.1.1, Subnet: 255.255.255.0
- PC1: IP: 192.168.1.2, Subnet: 255.255.255.0

## Steps Performed
1. Added two PCs and one switch in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Connected each PC to the switch using copper straight-through cables.
3. Configured static IP addresses on both PCs.
4. Tested connectivity by pinging PC1 from PC0.

## Test Results
The ping from PC0 to PC1 was successful, confirming communication over the LAN.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Basic LAN setup using switches
- Static IP configuration
- Connectivity verification with ping
