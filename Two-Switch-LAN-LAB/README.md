# Two Switch LAN LAB

## Objectives
Verify the connectivity between two PCs connected to different switches.

## Devices Used
- 2 switches 2960
- 2 PCs

## IP Configurations
- PC0 IP: 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
- PC1 IP: 192.168.1.3 255.255.255.0

## Steps Performed
- Added two Cisco 2960 Switches to the Cisco Packet Tracer workspace.
- Added two PCs to the workspace.
- Used the copper straight-through cable to connect from Switch to PC.
- Used a copper cross-over to connect from Switch0 to Switc1.
- Configured IP addresses on both PCs.
- Tested connectivity by pinging PC0 from PC1.

## Test Result
The ping was from PC0 to PC1 successfully, verifying communication/connectivity.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Basic LAN topology design using multiple switches
- Switch-to-switch connectivity and cable type selection
- IP addressing and connectivity verification using ping
